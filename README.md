# Overview
The following project is a simple journaling website built using react and google firestore. The journaling site includes an entry box as well as displays all previous journals. An entry is sent to the database upon submission.

In order to run, begin by typing `cd journal-app` into the terminal. Afterwhich, type `npm start` into the same terminal. If these do not work, make sure to have `create-react-app` and `firestore` installed in your directory. If everything works correctly, a new window should appear in your browser.

To use the app, simply type into the text box, press submit, and your entry will be displayed in the Journal Entry section. 

My purpose for doing this project was to learn how to use react, and implement a database into it.
